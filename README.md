# vaadin-jetty94-failure
Demonstrates incompatiblity between vaadin 8.8.1 and Jetty 9.4

executable jar:
mvn clean compile package

Or the org.test.Starter has a main class, that starts up the embedded jetty.
Jetty version is 9.4.18.v20190429
Vaadin version is 8.8.1

There is a branch with a workaround here
